content_title: VECTRUM Overview
---

VECTRUM is the next-generation blockchain platform for creating and deploying smart contracts and distributed applications. VECTRUM comes with a number of programs. The primary ones included in VECTRUM are the following:

* [vectrum-node](./01_node/index.md) (node + vectrum = vectrum-node)  - core service daemon that runs a node for block production, API endpoints, or local development.
* [vectrum-cli](./02_cli/index.md) (cli + vectrum = vectrum-cli) - command line interface to interact with the blockchain (via `vectrum-node`) and manage wallets (via `vectrum-wallet`).
* [vectrum-wallet](./03_wallet/index.md) (wallet + vectrum = vectrum-wallet) - component that manages VECTRUM keys in wallets and provides a secure enclave for digital signing.

The basic relationship between these components is illustrated in the diagram below.
