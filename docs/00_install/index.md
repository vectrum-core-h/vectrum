There are various ways to install and use the VECTRUM software:

* [Install VECTRUM Prebuilt Binaries](./00_install-prebuilt-binaries.md)
* [Build VECTRUM from Source](./01_build-from-source/index.md)

[[info]]
| If you are new to VECTRUM, it is recommended that you install the [VECTRUM Prebuilt Binaries](./00_install-prebuilt-binaries.md). If you are an advanced developer, a block producer, or no binaries are available for your platform, you may need to [Build VECTRUM from source](01_build-from-source/index.md) instead.
