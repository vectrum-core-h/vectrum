content_title: Uninstall VECTRUM
---

If you have previously built VECTRUM from source and now wish to install the prebuilt binaries, or to build from source again, it is recommended to run the `uninstall.sh` script within the `vectrum/scripts` folder:

```sh
cd ~/vectrum-core/vectrum
sudo ./uninstall.sh
```

[[info | Uninstall Dependencies]]
| The uninstall script will also prompt the user to uninstall VECTRUMÂ Dependencies. This is recommended if installing prebuilt VECTRUM binaries or building VECTRUM for the first time.
