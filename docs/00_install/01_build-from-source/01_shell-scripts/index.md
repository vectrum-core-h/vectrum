[[info | Did you know?]]
| Shell scripts automate the process of building, installing, testing, and uninstalling the VECTRUM software and dependencies.

To build VECTRUMÂ from the source code using shell scripts, visit the sections below:

1. [Download VECTRUM Source](./01_download-source.md)
2. [Build VECTRUM Binaries](./02_build-binaries.md)
3. [Install VECTRUM Binaries](./03_install-binaries.md)
4. [Test VECTRUM Binaries](./04_test-binaries.md)
5. [Uninstall VECTRUM](./05_uninstall.md)

[[info | Building VECTRUM is for Advanced Developers]]
| If you are new to VECTRUM, it is recommended that you install the [VECTRUM Prebuilt Binaries](../../00_install-prebuilt-binaries.md) instead of building from source.
