[[info | Building VECTRUM is for Advanced Developers]]
| If you are new to VECTRUM, it is recommended that you install the [VECTRUM Prebuilt Binaries](../00_install-prebuilt-binaries.md) instead of building from source.

VECTRUM can be built on several platforms using different build methods. Advanced users may opt to build VECTRUM using our shell scripts. Node operators or block producers who wish to deploy a public node, may prefer our manual build instructions.

* [Shell Scripts](01_shell-scripts/index.md) - Suitable for the majority of developers, these scripts build on Mac OS and many flavors of Linux.
* [Manual Build](02_manual-build/index.md) - Suitable for those platforms that may be hostile to the shell scripts or for operators who need more control over their builds.

[[info | VECTRUM Installation Recommended]]
| After building VECTRUM successfully, it is highly recommended to install the VECTRUM binaries from their default build directory. This copies the VECTRUM binaries to a central location, such as `/usr/local/bin`, or `~/vectrum/x.y/bin`, where `x.y` is the VECTRUM release version.
